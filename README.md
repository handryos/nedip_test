## User Stories and Functional Requirements

Here you have the functional requirements for the application. You are free to make any assumptions you consider necessary to complete the challenge.

You can use the following user stories as a guide to implement the application features:

1 - Authentication

1. [ ] As a user, I want to log in using a fixed email and password.

2 - Projects Management

1. [ ] As a user, I want to change the attributes (liberation status, instalation status) of a projects after creating it so that I can keep the project information updated.
1. [ ] As a user, I want to delete a project when it is no longer in use so that it doesn't clutter the system.

3 - Poles

1. [ ] As a user, I want to create at least two poles with arbitrary names for an existing project.
1. [ ] As a user, I want to update, delete and get the poles.

4 - Ambiguity Handling

1. [ ] Make reasonable assumptions and design the application accordingly for any ambiguities in the challenge.

5 - Technical requirements

1. [ ] Use TypeScript.
1. [ ] Use React.
1. [ ] Use Next.js.
1. [ ] Use Material UI 5 for styling the application.
1. [ ] Create reusable components.
1. [ ] The code is well-organized and documented.
1. [ ] Use Express.js Framework for the back-end.
1. [ ] If you choose to use PostgreSQL, use Sequelize.js ORM to interact with PostgreSQL.
The choice of remaining tools is at your discretion.

6 - Bonus

1. [ ] Deploy your application to a cloud provider and provide a link for the running app.
1. [ ] The application layout is responsive.

7 - Tips

1. [ ] There is no need to reinvent the wheel. You can use a Material UI 5 already implemented components to help in your development process.

1. [ ] Anyone should be able to follow the instructions and run the application.
1. [ ] User stories were implemented according to the functional requirements.
1. [ ] Ability to refactor existing code (if applicable).
1. [ ] Adherence to best practices in front-end development.
1. [ ] Problem-solving skills and ability to handle ambiguity.
1. [ ] Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
